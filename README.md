# Reimagined Scratch
A browser extension for improving Scratch's looks.

This is unfinished and has some bugs. 

[Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reimagined-scratch/)

[Here](https://github.com/MasterOfTheTiger/reimagine-scratch/projects/) is a list of what I am working on and what has been done. 


## Credits
- I (MasterOfTheTiger) did most of the work on this extension
- The code for bringing back of the discuss button is inspired from [2003kaito's extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bring_it_back/).
- Google translate for the different languages for discuss button
